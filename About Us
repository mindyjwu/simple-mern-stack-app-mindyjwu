Hello! 

My name is Mindy, currently a senior at NYU doing Computer Science and Data Science with minor in Econom ics and Business Entertainment Media and Technology.
I love going to the gym, cook, drink, paint, and hanging out with friends. During weekend, I love hanging out at the park or clubs because
the park has my dogs, trees, and cute babies. I also love club because there is music, drinks, and my friends. 

Currently on campus, I am engaged in two main clubs: Taiwanese American Student Society and Data Science Club. Feel free to ask
me any questions regarding these two clubs or the events we are hosting this semester. 
I am leaving New York City end of the summer to move to LA for my job, but I am not certain on what I want to do in my life yet. 
I am super extroverted and love meeting new people, please do say hi to me.
